On November 1st and 2nd, cemeteries transform into candlelit gatherings where families picnic, share stories, and welcome spirits home. You'll learn to make papel picado (cut paper decorations), paint your face as a catrina, taste pan de muerto (bread of the dead), and understand the indigenous Zapotec beliefs that blend with Catholic traditions. This isn't macabre—it's a joyful, colorful affirmation that death is part of life's cycle.",
