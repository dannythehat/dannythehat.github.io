    "longDescription": "Once a year, the world's most secretive nation opens its doors to foreign runners. The Pyongyang Marathon offers an unparalleled glimpse behind the curtain: wide boulevards lined with cheering (or assigned) spectators, monumental architecture celebrating the regime, and a finish line in the largest stadium on Earth. The race is genuine—your time counts for international records—but everything around it exists in an alternate reality. It's the ultimate combination of athletic achievement and geopolitical surrealism.",
