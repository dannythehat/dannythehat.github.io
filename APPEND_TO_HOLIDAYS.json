This 10-day journey takes you through the heart of the Cyclades, starting in Athens before sailing to Santorini, Mykonos, and Naxos. Watch the sun set over Santorini's caldera from Oia, turning white-washed buildings golden and the sea into liquid fire. Explore the ancient ruins of Delos, birthplace of Apollo. Dance until dawn in Mykonos, then escape to quiet beaches on Naxos. Taste fresh seafood, local wine, and the famous Greek hospitality. Every island has its own character, but all share that intoxicating Mediterranean magic that makes you never want to leave.",
